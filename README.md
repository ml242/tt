##Challenges Faced
* Ember was not easy for me to configure, hence the current state of the application. The features it gives you seem limitless, but there are strong opinions about where to place files and how to wrap objects. This created a steep learning curve for me.

* My approach to this project started by modeling my schema and drawing sketches of the dataTypes that would compose TinyTrello.

* After reading the guides, doing the two Official Tutorials, I thought I could give it a spin but it didn't work well. I am not able to create records in my Component although I can from the index.js in the Controller. So there is simply a configuration issue that I seem to be stuck on.

I am looking forward to working with Ember some more to see what is possible when one is more acclimated to the framework.
